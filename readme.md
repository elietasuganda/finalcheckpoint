About HTML and CSS

This is assignment HTML and CSS about beuaty salon web and i create for registration

In this case, include:
1. I use <div class=‘navbar’> for grouping navigation and for css I also use position: fixed so that the header does not sink when the web is scrolled down and the user will be easier to access.
2. Picture, I include 5 images that show the treatment at the beauty salon, and use section class coding.
3. Audio: !<audio src="/week1/audio/audio_example.wav" controls></audio>
4. Registration:
    1. Full name, I used a for=‘name’ label and the input type is text
    2. Email, I use the for=‘email’ label and the input type is email, so that if you don't enter an email format, there will be a warning when you click submit
    3. Phone number, I use the label for=‘number’ and the input type is number, so it cannot input other than numbers
    4. Address, I use the for=‘message’ label and textarea id=‘message’ which allows users to input more than 1 line
    5. Visit, I use for=‘date’ label and the input type is datetime-local, where the user can choose the day and time they want to visit
    6. Gender, I use select name=‘gender’ and id=‘gender’ option value=‘male’ option value="female’.
    select is used to choose one option from the available options and option is used to define the choice made with the <select> element.
    7. Treatment, consists of input type=‘checkbox’, id, name, value.
    I use checkbox because it can select more than one option, id provides identification for the checkbox element, so that if the label is clicked then the checkbox will be ticked, name is used to name the variable, this value determines the value sent to the system, if the checkbox is not ticked, then this value will not be sent.
5. Button submit

In this web I use @media (max-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 600px) where if the web resolution is less than 1200px and 600px then the web display will adjust.
